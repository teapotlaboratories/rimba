# RISK-01 IBSS — hardening to-do log

Running backlog to take the IBSS implementation from "two boards exchange IP"
(RISK-01 resolved, see [`rimba-ibss-milestones.md`](rimba-ibss-milestones.md)) to
something robust enough for the Rimba mesh. **Governing rule still applies: derive
behaviour from the Linux side** (`net/mac80211/ibss.c`, `morse_driver`) — see
memory `ibss-base-on-linux-implementation`.

Status: ☐ todo · ◐ in progress · ☑ done. Update this log as items move.

## Known limitations from the bring-up (the starting point)
The working implementation deliberately took shortcuts to prove the link:
- **Single shared peer `stad`** for the whole cell — RX dedup/sequence tracking
  is one space shared across all peers; correct for 2 nodes, wrong for >2.
- **No IBSS merge** — BSSID is hardcoded and the role is a MAC heuristic in the
  app; no TSF-based merge / join-existing-cell discovery.
- **Open/plaintext only** — peer marked `MMWLAN_OPEN`; no encryption.
- **No ATIM / power save** — ATIM window 0 (always awake).
- **Verified with IP (0x0800)**, not the literal Rimba EtherType `0x88B5`.
- **No teardown/disable path**; bring-up assumes a clean boot state.

## Backlog (prioritised)

### P1 — protocol-critical for Rimba
1. ☑ **Raw `0x88B5` frame exchange.** Done 2026-06-19. App broadcasts raw EtherType
   `0x88B5` L2 frames via `mmwlan_tx()` (bare 802.3 frame); `halow_rx` surfaces
   received `0x88B5` (lwIP would drop the unknown type). Verified bidirectional on
   the 2-board bench (each node RXes the peer's `RIMBA-88B5 seq=N`), concurrent
   with IP ping. The literal Phase-1 gate passes over the same IBSS data path as IP.
2. ☑ **Per-peer station records (multi-node).** Done 2026-06-19. Replaced the
   single shared `stad` with a `peers[]` table: each peer discovered on first RX
   (get-or-add keyed by transmitter MAC, mirroring `ieee80211_ibss_add_sta`) gets
   its own `umac_sta_data` + AID, so RX dedup/seq is now per-peer. The BSSID is
   excluded (S1G beacons carry SA=BSSID and aren't caught by the legacy
   `(MGMT,BEACON)` pre-assoc filter → would otherwise mint a bogus peer). TX still
   uses one shared queue (per-peer TX keying moves with CCMP). New public API
   `mmwlan_ibss_get_peers()` snapshots the table. Verified on the bench: each node
   forms exactly one peer record for the other (stable AID), data path healthy.
   **Finding (for #3):** registering the peer with the firmware via SET_STA_STATE
   (to get a keyable station handle) returns **-116 on the ADHOC interface**, and
   since `morse_cmd_tx` blocks, calling it from the RX/core-task context stalls
   the datapath. So firmware-station registration is deferred to #3 and must run
   off the hot path with the -116 understood first. Full verification of >2 nodes
   still needs ≥3 boards.
3. ◐ **Hop-by-hop encryption (AES-128-CCM).** Rimba spec wants CCMP hop-by-hop;
   move off OPEN. **Attempted 2026-06-19 — blocked, needs a different approach
   (see below). Reverted to working plaintext.**

### P2 — robustness / correctness
16. ☐ **Fix peer-extraction from the reference S1G beacon (Linux interop).** *Found
    in the 2026-06-20 Linux IBSS interop run (test plan I.2).* The ESP32 beacon-aware
    peer discovery (`umac_ibss_get_or_add_peer`, `src/umac/umac.c`) reads the
    transmitter MAC from the wrong offset in `morse_driver`'s **S1G beacon** frames —
    the offset lands in the beacon **TSF timestamp**, so every Linux beacon mints a
    fresh phantom peer (observed: `48:63:3d:08:00:d5`, `48:f3:3e:…`, 3rd byte tracking
    the timestamp). The 8-slot table floods with garbage, the Linux peer's real MAC is
    never recorded, and ESP32-initiated unicast goes to non-existent IPs. **The data
    path is unaffected** (Linux→ESP32 ping works; the ESP32 replies correctly), so this
    is isolated to peer-discovery TA parsing of the reference **S1G (compressed/EXT)
    MAC header** vs our hand-built beacon layout. Fix the offset (parse the S1G beacon
    header properly, or only seed peers from frames with a reliable TA — probe-resp /
    data, as Linux's `sta_info` effectively does), then re-run I.1/I.2. Relates to #14
    (age-out would also evict phantoms) and #11 (capture the on-wire S1G beacon to get
    the exact field layout).
4. ☐ **IBSS merge (TSF).** Discover peers via beacons and converge on a common
   BSSID/TSF (higher-TSF wins), per `ieee80211_rx_bss_info`. Replaces the
   hardcoded-BSSID + MAC-role bench heuristic with real create/join semantics
   (scan → join existing, else create). **Pairs with #14 (age-out): merge makes
   peer membership a real state machine, and add/remove are two sides of it.**
5. ☐ **Beacon contention.** Real IBSS has distributed beaconing (a node suppresses
   its beacon if it heard one for the interval). Currently every node beacons
   every interval unconditionally — fine for 2, a storm risk as density grows.
6. ☐ **Teardown / disable / re-enable.** `mmwlan_ibss_disable()` (stop beaconing,
   `IBSS_CONFIG STOP`, remove interface, free the stad); handle re-enable and
   param/channel change cleanly.
7. ☐ **Drop bench heuristics.** Remove the MAC-based role pick + hardcoded IPs in
   the app once merge + proper create/join land.
14. ☐ **Peer age-out / free (follow-on to #2).** Per-peer records are currently
    heap-allocated on first RX and **never freed** — a departed peer lingers; the
    table caps at 8 then overflows to the shared record, and the heap is grow-only.
    Stamp `last_rx` per peer, sweep on the beacon/work timer, and free the record +
    release its AID when idle past a limit. **Linux ref (governing rule):**
    `net/mac80211/ibss.c` `ieee80211_ibss_sta_expire()` on a timer, dropping peers
    idle past `IEEE80211_IBSS_INACTIVITY_LIMIT` (60 s). Best built **with #4**, since
    proper join semantics already need peer add *and* remove. **Why it matters:**
    (a) bounds the heap and unblocks >8-node cells; (b) it is the prerequisite for
    honest **survivor-side** drop/rejoin testing — observed in the P0.6 bench
    (2026-06-19), where survivors could not re-acquire a returned same-MAC peer
    because the record never expired (see test plan §8.1 and the P0 worklog). Until
    age-out exists, "rediscovered as a fresh record" is impossible on the survivor
    side by construction.

### P3 — power & de-risking
8. ☐ **ATIM / IBSS power save (RISK-06-ish, Rimba leaves).** Battery leaves need
   doze; implement the ATIM window + buffered-traffic announcement. Check whether
   the MM6108 firmware exposes IBSS PS at all (Open Issue #6).
9. ☐ **RISK-02 — measure IBSS boot/join time.** Dev plan targets `LEAF_BOOT_MS=30`;
   never measured. GPIO-toggle / timestamp from power-on to first beacon
   heard/joined. Gates Scheduled mode.
10. ☐ **>2-node test.** Validate beacons, discovery, and data with 3+ nodes (needs
    more boards) — depends on #2.
11. ☐ **Verify the S1G beacon on-wire.** Only the probe response was decoded; the
    actual `EXT/S1G_BEACON` frame's framing (compat IE, etc.) is chip-side and
    unverified — capture via a monitor interface.

### P4 — code quality
12. ☐ **Factor IBSS out of `umac.c`** into `umac_ibss.c` (beacon, probe-resp,
    datapath ops, bring-up) for separation and easier upstream-diffing.
13. ☐ **Review all STA/AP-only assumptions** in morselib for other ADHOC drops
    (the RX-VIF bug was one; audit for siblings).
15. ☐ **Bump the ESP32 stack to latest (fw / SDK / IDF).** Current pins:
    MM6108 firmware **1.17.6**, `morsemicro/halow` (morselib + mm-iot-sdk) fork
    **`2.10.4-esp32-2`**, ESP-IDF **v5.4.2**. Move each to the latest stable.
    Caveats / cost (this is not a plain version-bump):
    - **The IBSS port patches morselib** (the ADHOC interface, IBSS commands,
      beacon/probe-resp, datapath RX-VIF fix live on the `mm-esp32-halow` fork). A
      morselib/mm-iot-sdk bump means **re-applying and re-validating those patches**
      on the new base — budget for a real port-forward, not a fast-forward.
    - **Keep generation parity with the Linux reference node** (P0.5 interop, test
      plan §2): bump the ESP32 *and* the chronium `morse_driver`/firmware **together**
      to the same MM release, or pin both deliberately — a one-sided bump invalidates
      the interop result. See `rimba-ibss-linux-interop-runbook.md`.
    - **Toolchain pin:** keep cmake on **3.x** (4.x breaks the ESP-IDF build, per
      README) when moving IDF.
    - **Regress after any bump:** re-run the 3-board P0 bench (and the AP-STA ping)
      before trusting the new base.

## Findings

### CCMP attempt (2026-06-19) — blocked on the chip's key model
Tried the simplest Rimba-aligned model: one shared **GROUP** CCMP key (the
deployment key) for all frames, installed via `umac_keys_install_key` (cipher is
always `AES_CCM`; `umac_keys_init` is required first since `umac_sta_data_alloc_static`
only memsets). Made IBSS unicast use the group key too. Encrypted ping failed
(`ok=0`, some sends succeed but no replies). Two hard blockers identified:
- **Group key can't decrypt unicast.** HW CCMP RX uses the *pairwise* key for
  unicast; a unicast frame encrypted with the group key isn't decrypted by the
  peer (some TX went out, zero replies).
- **Pairwise keys need an AID.** `mmdrv_install_key(vif_id, aid, ...)` keys a
  pairwise key to a STA's AID. IBSS has **no association → no AID**, so a static
  pairwise key can't be keyed to a peer.

**Root cause (revised after reading the Linux side, 2026-06-19).** It is *not* a
chip limitation. How Linux does IBSS CCMP (`wpa_supplicant/ibss_rsn.c` +
`net/mac80211`):
- A **`sta_info` per peer**, keyed by **MAC address** (`ieee80211_ibss_add_sta`).
  No association, but the station record still exists.
- Per pair, a **4-way handshake** runs; the PTK from the handshake **initiated by
  the higher-MAC node** is the one used (`ibss_rsn.c:163-168` tie-break).
- The **PTK is installed against the peer's MAC** (`supp_set_key` →
  `wpa_drv_set_key(addr=peer->addr, key_idx=0)`) → unicast uses it. Each node has
  its own **GTK** for broadcast; RX broadcast decrypts with the *sender's* GTK.
- The driver maps `sta_info` → a hardware **station handle** for the key table.

On the MM6108 that station handle is the `aid` field. The firmware already exposes
the two primitives Linux uses, and morselib already implements both — but only
drives them from the **AP association** path:
- `MORSE_CMD_ID_SET_STA_STATE` (0x14): binds **`sta_addr` (MAC) + `aid` + state**
  (NONE→AUTH→ASSOC→AUTHORIZED — the `ieee80211_sta_state` enum). This is the
  `morse_op_sta_state` reflection. (`driver.c:858`, used by `umac_connection.c`.)
- `MORSE_CMD_ID_INSTALL_KEY` (0x0A): PTK/GTK keyed by that `aid` + key_idx.

So the shared-group-key attempt failed because **IBSS has no per-peer station
record** → no `aid` to bind a pairwise key to. The `aid` is just a station handle,
exactly like Linux's sta_info→key-slot mapping; it does **not** require a real
association AID.

**Update 2026-06-19 (from #2):** the host-side per-peer records + AID assignment
now exist (#2 done). But the firmware half — `SET_STA_STATE(peer_mac, aid,
AUTHORIZED)` — **returns -116 on the ADHOC interface**, so the firmware does not
mint a station handle for an IBSS peer the way it does on association. Until that
is understood, there is no `aid` the firmware will accept an `INSTALL_KEY` against,
so even static per-peer CCMP is blocked at the firmware boundary. Next concrete
step for #3: investigate why SET_STA_STATE rejects ADHOC peers (interface state?
a different/added command? unsupported for adhoc on this fw build?), driving it
off the RX hot path. Check `morse_driver`'s `morse_op_sta_state` for the adhoc
sequence the kernel driver uses.

**Corrected path (CCMP once the firmware station handle works):**
1. **Per-peer station records (#2 / P1.2)** — DONE host-side. The firmware
   `SET_STA_STATE(peer_mac, aid, AUTHORIZED)` (the `ieee80211_ibss_add_sta` +
   driver `sta_state` cb mirror) currently returns -116 on adhoc; resolve first.
2. **Then CCMP**, two flavours:
   - **(a) static pre-shared** — install a pre-shared PTK against each peer's `aid`
     (unicast) + a shared GTK (broadcast). No handshake; minimal; non-standard but
     uses the real per-peer key mechanism.
   - **(b) full IBSS RSN** — drive the bundled `ibss_rsn.c` (per-peer 4-way
     handshake, higher-MAC = authenticator) → `INSTALL_KEY` per peer. Standards-
     correct; the work is glue (driver `set_key`→morselib, peer add/remove, EAPOL
     routing). 
This reorders the backlog: **#2 is the prerequisite for #3.** Reverted the WIP;
tree is back to working plaintext + dynamic ARP.

## Done
- ☑ RISK-01 core: IBSS bring-up, beacon, probe-answering, IP data path with
  dynamic ARP (see milestones doc).
- ☑ Raw `0x88B5` L2 exchange verified bidirectional (P1.1, 2026-06-19).
- ☑ Per-peer station records — one `sta_data`+AID per discovered peer, BSSID
  excluded, `mmwlan_ibss_get_peers()` API (P1.2, 2026-06-19).
- ☑ Stop tracking generated `*.mbin.o` build artifacts.
