# Rimba

A sparse-first, delay-tolerant networking (DTN) mesh protocol for massive-scale
IoT deployment in remote and intermittently-connected areas.

Rimba carries CBOR sensor payloads inside BPv7 bundles (RFC 9171) over an
802.11ah (Wi-Fi HaLow) IBSS mesh, using store-carry-forward and mobile data
"mules" to bridge network partitions. Nodes are battery-optimized and
RTC-scheduled; traffic to the backend is always end-to-end encrypted.

## Status

**Draft 0.28 — design stage; Phase-1 IBSS foundation validated on hardware.**

Development started with the BLOCKING hardware-validation phase. **Before writing
any feature, read the [development plan](docs/rimba-development-plan.md)** — it
defines the phased build order and the IBSS-foundation phase everything depends on.

**RISK-01 (IBSS on the MM6108) is resolved, hardened, and validated**: 802.11ah ad-hoc
bring-up, bidirectional IP/`0x88B5` data, a 3-board full mesh, peer age-out + drop/rejoin,
interop with a Linux `morse_driver` IBSS node on the same silicon, and a **~6.5 h 4-node
soak** (0 reboots, no heap leak) — all derived from and verified against the Linux
implementation. See [`docs/ibss/rimba-ibss-milestones.md`](docs/ibss/rimba-ibss-milestones.md),
the [test plan](docs/ibss/rimba-ibss-test-plan.md), and the [IBSS worklogs](docs/worklog/).
**Next: power-save bring-up** (RTC-scheduled radio duty-cycle — the morse firmware has no
IBSS radio power-save), then Phase-2 link security.

**Current phase — the L2-layer decision: IBSS vs Mesh-gate.** Rimba's link layer has two
viable options on the MM6108, so **both are being built on hardware and compared** rather
than committing early:

- **IBSS / ad-hoc** (above) — symmetric, infrastructure-free; **resolved + hardened + soaked**.
  Its dead-end is **leaf power-save**: this firmware has no IBSS radio power-save.
- **Mesh-gate (802.11s mesh + AP)** — relays mesh together; leaves are STAs that **TWT-sleep**
  under a relay-AP that buffers their downlink. **Proven on hardware:** AP-mode, the TWT
  responder + the power-save fix (a dozing leaf really sleeps), multi-STA TWT, and STA-count
  scaling to **255** (four-block S1G TIM). **Open:** ESP32 mesh+AP concurrency (proven on Linux
  only). See [`docs/mesh-ap/rimba-mesh-ap-milestones.md`](docs/mesh-ap/rimba-mesh-ap-milestones.md) (milestones,
  the new-code ↔ Linux `morse_driver`/`dot11ah` maps, and the Mesh-gate TODO).

Neither L2 is chosen yet — making them comparable on the same silicon is the point of this phase.

See Section 15 (Open Issues) and Section 16 (Future Investigations) in the spec
for tracked work, including the urgent config-changeable-parameter-scope security
boundary (Issue #13).

## Where to start

2. **[`docs/rimba-development-plan.md`](docs/rimba-development-plan.md)** — start here if you are building. Phased plan, risk register, and the Phase 1 IBSS-foundation tasks. Includes the RISK-01 fallback strategy (what to do if IBSS doesn't work, incl. the AP-STA path and its HELLO/discovery implications).
3. **[`docs/design-specification/rimba-protocol-spec.md`](docs/design-specification/rimba-protocol-spec.md)** — the normative specification. Read for protocol details.
4. The companion analyses (below) — background that informed the design.

## Hardware baseline

- **MCU:** ESP32-S3
- **Radio:** Morse Micro MM6108 (802.11ah HaLow, single radio per node)
- **RTC:** RV-3028-C7 (≤1 ppm), mandatory for scheduled wake (deferrable to Phase 4 via NTP dev-mode — see development plan)
- **PHY:** sub-GHz (902–928 MHz US), ~1 km range, 1–2 MHz channels

## Node roles

- **Leaf** — battery sensor; sleeps, wakes on RTC schedule, sends/receives on wake.
- **Relay** — always-on forwarder; backbone, DTN store, leaf scheduling.
- **Mule** — mobile relay superset; physically carries bundles between partitions. Designed to work without stopping (a stop is a bonus that widens the contact window).
- **Gateway** — backbone egress to the backend (`ipn:1.*`); cloud is `ipn:2.*`.

## Protocol stack

```
CBOR payload
  → BPSec / COSE  (E2E encryption, RFC 9172 / 9052 / 9053)
  → BPv7 bundle   (DTN store-carry-forward, RFC 9171)
  → mesh routing  (OGM / RREQ / geo)
  → custom convergence layer
  → 802.11ah IBSS (EtherType 0x88B5, AES-128-CCM hop-by-hop)
```

## Building the firmware

The firmware lives under [`firmware/`](firmware/) and targets the ESP32-S3.
Several apps exist (select with `APP=`):
- **`rimba-hello`** — radio-free sanity check (toolchain + 8 MB PSRAM, RISK-04).
- **`rimba-halow-scan`** — boots the MM6108 HaLow radio over SPI and scans for
  APs. Confirmed working (firmware v1.17.6, chip ID 0x0306).
- **`rimba-halow-ap`** + **`rimba-halow-sta`** — a 2-board AP↔STA ping test.
  Confirmed on hardware: bidirectional IP, ~12 ms RTT over 802.11ah — the
  Phase-1 RISK-01 AP-STA link validated end-to-end.
- **`rimba-halow-ibss`** — the **IBSS / ad-hoc** mesh app (RISK-01 resolved). One
  binary on every node: N-node MAC-derived addressing, peer discovery, and pings
  to every peer. Validated on hardware — 3-board full mesh **and** interop with a
  Linux `morse_driver` IBSS node. See
  [`docs/ibss/rimba-ibss-milestones.md`](docs/ibss/rimba-ibss-milestones.md).

See [`firmware/README.md`](firmware/README.md) for per-example detail.

### Two separate SDKs (and why)

A Rimba node has two chips, each with its own SDK — don't confuse them:

| | SDK | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| **ESP32-S3** (host MCU) | **ESP-IDF** (Espressif) | The build system (`idf.py`, CMake/Ninja), FreeRTOS, drivers, crypto. **Everything compiles against this — it is required.** |
| **MM6108** (HaLow radio, over SPI) | **`morsemicro/halow`** (Morse Micro) | `morselib` driver + firmware blobs, from the [ESP Component Registry](https://components.espressif.com/components/morsemicro/halow). **Vendored as git submodules** under `components/` (forked at `2.10.4-esp32-2`) for reproducibility, not auto-downloaded. Requires ESP-IDF ≥ 5.4.2. |

```
ESP32-S3  (runs ESP-IDF) ──SPI──▶ MM6108  (driven by morselib from morsemicro/halow)
   host MCU                          HaLow radio
```

> The `vendor/mm-iot-sdk` submodule is **reference only** (full docs + the
> complete BCF set). The build does *not* use it — the radio code comes from the
> vendored `components/halow` + `components/firmware` submodules.

So **ESP-IDF is the mandatory toolchain**; it is vendored at `vendor/esp-idf`, and
the MM6108 radio code ships as git submodules under `components/` (init them when
cloning). Set up the vendored ESP-IDF first (below).

### 1. One-time toolchain setup

> **Install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com) before cloning** (`git lfs install`) — some docs (e.g.
> `docs/reference/MM_APPNOTE-24_Linux_Porting_Guide.pdf`) are stored via LFS. If you cloned without it, run
> `git lfs install && git lfs pull` to fetch the real files (otherwise you get small pointer stubs).

ESP-IDF is **vendored as a git submodule at `vendor/esp-idf`** (pinned at v5.4.2,
the minimum required by the `morsemicro/halow` component). Check it out with its
own submodules, then install the toolchain from it:

```bash
git submodule update --init vendor/esp-idf          # if not cloned --recurse-submodules
git -C vendor/esp-idf submodule update --init --recursive
./vendor/esp-idf/install.sh esp32s3

# cmake + ninja (ESP-IDF does not bundle them on Linux).
# Pin cmake to 3.x — cmake 4.x breaks the ESP-IDF build.
~/.espressif/python_env/idf5.4_py*_env/bin/pip install "cmake==3.30.5" ninja
# (or, if you have sudo: apt install cmake ninja-build)
```

The Makefile's default `IDF_PATH` points at `vendor/esp-idf`, so the build uses
the vendored toolchain automatically (override `IDF_PATH=...` for a different one).

### 2. Build / flash / monitor

Run from the **repo root** (the `Makefile` wraps `idf.py` and sources the ESP-IDF
environment for you). Make sure the `components/` submodules are checked out first
(`git submodule update --init components/halow components/firmware`).

`APP` selects the example (default `rimba-halow-scan`) and `BOARD` selects the
board config under `boards/` (default `proto1`):

```bash
make build                        # rimba-halow-scan on board proto1 (defaults)
make flash                        # flash to /dev/ttyACM0
make monitor                      # serial console (Ctrl-] to exit)
make flash-monitor
make build APP=rimba-hello        # the radio-free sanity example
```

Override defaults inline, e.g. `make flash PORT=/dev/ttyACM1`,
`make build BOARD=proto2`, or `make build IDF_PATH=/path/to/other/esp-idf`. Run
`make help` for the full list.

> The Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 enumerates over its native USB-Serial-JTAG as
> `/dev/ttyACM0`, used for both flashing and the console. Your user must be in the
> `dialout` group to access it.

Prefer raw `idf.py`? `source vendor/esp-idf/export.sh`, then work inside
`firmware/rimba-halow-scan/` — but pass the board config yourself, since the
Makefile is what wires it: `idf.py -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=../../boards/proto1/sdkconfig.defaults build`.
